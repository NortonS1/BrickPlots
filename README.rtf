###########NOTES############

Line 43 of the code grants the option to change how many clusters are formed for colouring the included markers. 
This can be set manually based on the elbow point plot included as the first generated figure.

Line 202 of the code grants the option to change the minimum value for a brick to be created, 
this is essentially setting the background threshold and may need to be altered to suit your dataset.
